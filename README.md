If you landed here, that must mean I shared my profile with you or you found me on a project I've contributed to.

I'm a web designer & engineer with around 10 years of experience designing and/or developing front-end projects.

Some stuff/palces I've worked recently includes [Scribd](https://www.scribd.com/), [ServiceNow's Horizon Design System](https://horizon.servicenow.com), and [Zendesk's Garden Design System]([url](https://garden.zendesk.com/)).

In general, I like playing the boundary of design and development when time allows, but I'm happy to focus on just one if needed.
